This is a prototype implementation of RFCs #1307 and #1309.  It is
intended that all functionality in this crate will be either
incorporated into libstd or dropped, so I do not intend for this crate
to ever have a stable release.

I originally thought this would be impossible to implement outside of
libstd, but it turns our you can do anything with sufficiently many
applications of mem::transmute.

How to use:

extern crate osstring_prototype;
use osstring_prototype::prelude::*;
// Pretend the RFCs have already been accepted and implemented.
